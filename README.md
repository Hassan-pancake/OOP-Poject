I've encountered Countless errors in everything and I've changed design 2-3 times however after getting burnt out 
and wasting 2 days I made this prototype which doesnt really completes the submission requirment or my needs or something I 
thought of. But It is close, I will do Better next time.
enemy base class (parent) tank enemies (child) inherting everything but their movement is diffrent (polyMorphism) Everything is 
under private seriazable feild I did not get any chance to use getters and setters (Enscaptulation) everything is structerd (almost)
and clear example of (Abstraction) in PlayerController.
